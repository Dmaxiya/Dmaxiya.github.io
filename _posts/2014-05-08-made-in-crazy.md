Break into my dream without permission,

I doubt what you want to do.

Never leave my mind when I am thinking,

I wonder what you are tricking.

<br/>

Stay away from me,

leave me alone.

Keep distance, for my fear of being closer.

Just use each other.

<br/>

Shut up !

Get out !

Fuck you guy !
